# R-Projects

Each folders contains a collection of R-scripts that I have worked on over the past year. 

A variety of skills were implemented:
- Text-search and fuzzy matching.
- Random forest algorithms to predict snow fall cover
- Integration of Terra package and QGis to reverse geocode, map and extract data from Shapefiles, Geopackages and Tif files.
- K-nearest neighbour to determine correlations with breast cancer in patients
- and much more.
